![skills matrix exercise app](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ac84159-b0f5-4e03-bf40-7f472642cadb)

## 🔥 What's This All About?

Let's be real—figuring out your career path is HARD. One day you're coding in bliss, the next you're questioning all your life choices because a CSS bug won't fix itself. Sound familiar?

Skills Matrix gives you something closer to career clarity. It's an interactive tool that helps you map out what you're actually good at (not what your LinkedIn says), what you need to work on (we all have those skills), what makes you jump out of bed in the morning, and what makes you want to hide under the covers.

## 💁‍♀️ Why Should You Care?

### 🧑‍💻 For the Code Wizards (Individual Contributors)

- ✨ Find your superpower combo, where talent meets your passion!
- 🎮 Level up strategically, stop wasting time on random tutorials and focus on skills that matter
- 💯 Nail that performance review
- 🚀 Make career moves with confidence. No more "Is this job right for me?" anxiety spirals

### 👑 For the People Herders (Engineering Managers)

- 🕶️ Discover your management style
- 👉 Delegate like a boss. "This task? Not my jam. Here YOU go!"
- 🌱 Actually help your reports. Guide them with something better than generic advice
- 🤔 Decide if you want that promotion. Technical leadership or people management? The eternal question...

### 🦋 For the Career Metamorphosis Crowd

- 🔄 Spot those transferable skills. Yes, your current skills ARE valuable elsewhere!
- 🎯 Target the right learning paths. Don't waste time on skills you'll hate using
- 💪 Interview with confidence. "Here's why I'm awesome despite my unconventional background"
- 🚩 Dodge bullet jobs. Identify roles that would make you miserable before it's too late

### 🏠 For the Life Skills Champions (Caregivers & Adulting Pros)
- 💎 Recognize your hidden professional skills. That chaos management at home? It's called "crisis leadership" at work!
- 🔄 Translate everyday experiences. "I managed a household budget" = "I have financial planning experience"
- 💪 Own those superpowers. Juggling family needs is elite-level stakeholder management
- 🌉 Bridge resume gaps with confidence. Caregiving years developed skills that companies desperately need

## ✨ Cool Features (Because We're Fancy Like That)

- 🧩 **Drag-and-drop quadrants** Because your skills aren't static and neither is this app
- ☕ **Hover for the tea** Info icons reveal the juicy details about each skill
- 🦄 **Add your own weird skills** "Cat herding" and "Explaining tech to grandparents" are valid skills too
- 📚 **Pre-loaded skill library** I did the boring work so you don't have to
- 🏠 **Caregiving & Life Skills included** Because managing a household is basically running a small business
- 💖 **Nonprofit sector focus** For the do-gooders making less money but more impact
- 💾 **Save your work** Export as JSON because even self-reflection needs a backup

## 🤓 How To Actually Use This Thing

1. 📝 **Fill those quadrants** Be honest! No one's watching (except your future self)

   - What you're good at (even if it's just "making coffee")
   - What you're not good at (we all suck at something)
   - What you enjoy (even if it's not "scalable")
   - What you'd rather never do again (life's too short)
2. **Play musical chairs with your skills** 🎵 Drag them around as you have existential realizations
3. **Connect the dots** 🔍

   - ❤️ **Sweet Spot** (Good At + Enjoy): Do more of this! Like, seriously, as much as possible.
   - 🌱 **Growth Zone** (Not Good At + Enjoy): Worth the grind! You'll actually stick with it.
   - 👋 **Delegation Station** (Good At + Don't Enjoy): Perfect for trading favors or outsourcing.
   - ☢️ **Danger Zone** (Not Good At + Don't Enjoy): Avoid like that ex who still has your Netflix password.

4. 🏠 **Don't forget your life skills!** 
   - Managed a household budget? That's financial planning!
   - Coordinated family schedules? Project management!
   - Cared for a loved one? That's stakeholder management, crisis response, and emotional intelligence!

5. 💾 **Save your masterpiece** Export and revisit when you're having your next career crisis

## 💅 Caregiving & Life Skills: The Secret Weapons on Your Resume

Let's be real—some of the most intense skill-building happens outside the office. If you've:

- 👶 **Raised tiny humans** You've mastered negotiation, conflict resolution, and operating under extreme sleep deprivation
- 👵 **Cared for aging parents** You've developed advocacy skills, systems navigation, and emotional resilience
- 🏠 **Managed a household** You've practiced vendor management, budgeting, and logistics coordination
- 🎉 **Planned family events** You've honed project management, stakeholder communication, and crisis management

These aren't "soft" skills—they're essential leadership capabilities that organizations desperately need but often undervalue. This Skills Matrix helps you identify, articulate, and leverage these powerful transferable skills in your professional life.

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff (For The Nerds Among Us)

Built with the cool kids' stack:

- Next.js (App Router because this thing isn't a dinosaur)
- React (duh)
- TypeScript (because I like catching errors before they catch me)
- Tailwind CSS (no more fighting with CSS, life's too short)
- shadcn/ui components (pretty buttons without the hassle)

Zero backend because who needs that drama? It all runs in your browser like magic. ✨

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Created because career advice like "follow your passion" and "network more" wasn't cutting it. Inspired by countless career crises and the realization that spreadsheets aren't always the answer (but sometimes they are).
