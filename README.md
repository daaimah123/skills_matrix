## 🔥 What's This All About?

Let's be real—figuring out your career path is HARD. One day you're coding in bliss, the next you're questioning all your life choices because a CSS bug won't fix itself. Sound familiar? *Eye roll*

Skills Matrix is your new BFF for career clarity. It's an interactive tool that helps you map out what you're actually good at (not what your LinkedIn says), what you need to work on (we all have those skills), what makes you jump out of bed in the morning, and what makes you want to hide under the covers.

## 💁‍♀️ Why Should You Care?

### 🧑‍💻 For the Code Wizards (Individual Contributors)

- ✨ **Find your superpower combo** Where your talent meets your passion—career jackpot!
- 🎮 **Level up strategically** Stop wasting time on random tutorials and focus on skills that matter
- 💯 **Nail that performance review** Come prepared with actual data, not just vibes
- 🚀 **Make career moves with confidence** No more "Is this job right for me?" anxiety spirals

### 👑 For the People Herders (Engineering Managers)

- 🕶️ **Discover your management style** Are you more Ted Lasso or Miranda Priestly?
- 👉 **Delegate like a boss** "This task? Not my jam. Here YOU go!"
- 🌱 **Actually help your reports** Guide them with something better than generic advice
- 🤔 **Decide if you want that promotion** Technical leadership or people management? The eternal question...

### 🦋 For the Career Metamorphosis Crowd

- 🔄 **Spot those transferable skills** Yes, your current skills ARE valuable elsewhere!
- 🎯 **Target the right learning paths** Don't waste time on skills you'll hate using
- 💪 **Interview with confidence** "Here's why I'm awesome despite my unconventional background"
- 🚩 **Dodge bullet jobs** Identify roles that would make you miserable before it's too late

## ✨ Cool Features (Because We're Fancy Like That)

- 🧩 **Drag-and-drop quadrants** Because your skills aren't static and neither is this app
- **Hover for the tea** ☕ Info icons reveal the juicy details about each skill
- 🦄 **Add your own weird skills** "Cat herding" and "Explaining tech to grandparents" are valid skills too
- 📚 **Pre-loaded skill library** We did the boring work so you don't have to
- 💖 **Nonprofit sector focus** For the do-gooders making less money but more impact
- 💾 **Save your work** Export as JSON because even self-reflection needs a backup

## 🤓 How To Actually Use This Thing

1. 📝 **Fill those quadrants** Be honest! No one's watching (except your future self)

   - What you're good at (even if it's just "making coffee")
   - What you're not good at (we all suck at something)
   - What you enjoy (even if it's not "scalable")
   - What you'd rather never do again (life's too short)
2. **Play musical chairs with your skills** 🎵 Drag them around as you have existential realizations
3. **Connect the dots** 🔍

   - ❤️ **Sweet Spot** (Good At + Enjoy): Do more of this! Like, seriously, as much as possible.
   - 🌱 **Growth Zone** (Not Good At + Enjoy): Worth the grind! You'll actually stick with it.
   - 👋 **Delegation Station** (Good At + Don't Enjoy): Perfect for trading favors or outsourcing.
   - ☢️ **Danger Zone** (Not Good At + Don't Enjoy): Avoid like that ex who still has your Netflix password.
4. 💾 **Save your masterpiece** Export and revisit when you're having your next career crisis

## 🛠️ Tech Stuff (For The Nerds Among Us)

Built with the cool kids' stack:

- Next.js (App Router because we're not dinosaurs)
- React (duh)
- TypeScript (because we like catching errors before they catch us)
- Tailwind CSS (no more fighting with CSS, life's too short)
- shadcn/ui components (pretty buttons without the hassle)

Zero backend because who needs that drama? It all runs in your browser like magic. ✨

## 👩‍💻 Local Dev Setup

### You'll Need:

- Node.js 16.8+ (older versions might work but we're not making any promises)
- npm or yarn (pick your poison)

### Get It Running:

1. Clone it like you mean it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skills-matrix.git
cd skills-matrix
```

Created because career advice like "follow your passion" and "network more" wasn't cutting it. Inspired by countless career crises and the realization that spreadsheets aren't always the answer (but sometimes they are).
